> Select all the columns and double click in between two columns, and Excel will automatically assign sufficient space to each column ðŸŽŠ


# Formulas and Functions
Making calculations with the cells.
> Click on an empty cell and type your formula there or on the formula bar
```
#Average = total over count
=(A1+A2+A3)/3
```
> This will give you a value. 

> Copy the cell you wrote the formula in side, select the cells you want to have it pasted inside, and paste
